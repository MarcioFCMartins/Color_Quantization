This is a small personnal project inspired on some blog posts (see below). The main goal is to create a function that takes a raster image as input and returns a color palette that best represents that image. While reading the posts about how the author of the PaletteR package tries to not only maximize how well a palette represents an image, but also make sure that colors are as distinguishable as possible, I decided to read up on how color quantization is normally performed. One of the most widely mentioned (and simpler) algorithms was called median cut. It seemed relatively simple and I decided to try and implement in in R.

Median cut algorithm:

This implementation is of the most basic version of the algorithm, meaning color palettes will always have a number of colors that is base 2.

Here is the result:
